# Project On NYPD Complaints Data

This is an extension to this [article](https://github.com/msr-ds3/coursework/blob/master/week4/ft_police_complaints.pdf) on complaints against police officers in New York City, Chicago, and Philadelphia. Our project aims to analyze further the data provided by the NYCLU, which can be accessed [here](https://github.com/new-york-civil-liberties-union/NYPD-Misconduct-Complaint-Database-Updated).

To view our work which focuses on the NY data, use this [link](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/msr-ds3/officer-complaints-2021-group-1/blob/main/project_extending_ny_complaints.html) to see an HTML rendered version.
